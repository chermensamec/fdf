char * mlx_get_data_addr ( void *img_ptr, int *bits_per_pixel, int *size_line, int *endian );
bits_per_pixel - number of bits needed to represent a pixel color (depth of the image (глубина изображения) )
size_line - is the number of bytes used to store one line of the image in memory. This information is needed to move from one line to another in the image
edian - tells you wether the pixel color in the image needs to be stored in: little
(endian == 0), or big (endian == 1)


In the image we keep all us window we can put pixel by just chaging of value in img.img
We shift on 8 Since each byte contains 2^8 = 256 values. First two num in hex its for blue power, next two blue power,
and next two for red.
